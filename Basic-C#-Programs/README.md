# C# Projects
These are some the small projects I have made for The Academy of Learning demonstrating basic C# and .NET framework utilizations.

## Projects:
* [Twenty One](https://github.com/nomadway/C-Sharp-Coding-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne/TwentyOneCardGame)
* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/nomadway/C-Sharp-Coding-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance-MVC)
* [Student Information](https://github.com/nomadway/C-Sharp-Coding-Projects/tree/main/StudentInfo)

### Twenty One
This is a basic console app that uses .NET Framework to create a Twenty One card game. It includes methods to generate a dealer, deck, and shuffled cards. Logic is used to create the basic rules of Twenty One. 

### Car Insurance
This is an MVC web application that replicates a car insurance website. Users inputs their information, and a quote is calculated based on logic. It includes an admin page to view all quotes issued as well as information about users. 

### Student Information
This is an MVC web application that creates a database by collecting student information. It collects student's name and contact details, and then stores the data in a table. It includes an admin page with functionality to view and/or remov users from the list.
